### An approach to tackle a Distributed Denial of Service (DDOS) attack

**Concepts**:

DOS and DDOS
---
A Denial of Service(DoS) attack is a malicious attempt to affect the availability of a targeted system, such as a website or application, to legitimate end users. Typically, attackers generate large volumes of packets or requests ultimately overwhelming the target system. In the case of DDOS attack, the attacker uses multiple compromised or controlled sources to generate the attack.

Attack targets
---
In the Open Systems Interconnection(OSI) model, the most common attack targets include:

**Infrastructure layer attacks**
* Network (layer 3)
* Transport (layer 4)

**Application layer attacks**
* Presentation (layer 6)
* Application (layer 7)
